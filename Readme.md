### Progress of Flask app
- [X] Build Home landing Page **(home.html)**
    - [X] On home landing page have slide image
    - [X] On home landing page have chossing box for us to choose algorihm  and Submit button
    - [X] With Submit button, we need it to redirrect to another page to show accuracy, MSE, cofusion_matrix,... of model in JSON format.
